The Ceasar Cipher is a method in which each letter in a message is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

This is a simple implementation of this method using javascript.

Currently only encrypts. Will be updating front-end and adding dycryption functionality.

Skills applied: HTML,CSS, Javascript
